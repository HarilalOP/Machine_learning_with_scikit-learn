# # üìù Exercise M4.01
# 
# The aim of this exercise is two-fold:
# 
# * understand the parametrization of a linear model;
# * quantify the fitting accuracy of a set of such models.
# 
# We will reuse part of the code of the course to:
# 
# * load data;
# * create the function representing a linear model.
# 
# ## Prerequisites
# 
# ### Data loading

penguins = pd.read_csv("../datasets/penguins_regression.csv")

def linear_model_flipper_mass(
    flipper_length, weight_flipper_length, intercept_body_mass
):
    """Linear model of the form y = a * x + b"""

    return body_mass


# ## Main exercise
# 
# Given a vector of the flipper length, several weights and intercepts to
# plot several linear model that could fit our data. Use the above
# visualization helper function to visualize both the model and data.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

weights = [-40, 45, 90]
intercepts = [15000, -5000, -14000]

ax = sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=feature_name, y=target_name,
                     color="black", alpha=0.5)

label = "{0:.2f} (g / mm) * flipper length + {1:.2f} (g)"
for weight, intercept in zip(weights, intercepts):
    predicted_body_mass = linear_model_flipper_mass(
        flipper_length_range, weight, intercept)

    ax.plot(flipper_length_range, predicted_body_mass,
            label=label.format(weight, intercept))
_ = ax.legend(loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(-0.25, 1.25), ncol=1)


# In the previous question, you were asked to create several linear models.
# The visualization allowed you to qualitatively assess if a model was better
# than another.
# 
# Now, you should come up with a quantitative measure which will indicate the
# goodness of fit of each linear model. This quantitative metric should result
# in a single scalar and allow you to pick up the best model.
